% \todo{This thesis states that the best way currently to evolve computer networks is
%   through the evolution of the control domain of networks. We state that in order to make
%   control more effective in a computer network, we need to  evolve control on the edges,
%   and expose an API to users and applications in order to allow them to express their
% interest more explicitly.  }
% 
% The evolution of human communication needs has been radical in the recent years and Internet
% has evolved as the main medium. It has become vital from many aspects of society, while Internet
% accesibility is slowly recognised as a fundamental human right. Network engineering hasn't
% been fully capable to support this development through sufficient innovatio. Network perfromance 
% requirements are enhanced and modern networks have
% become highly complex, as well as network performance requirements.  Although, link rates
% have inceased significantly, the complexity of modern networks hardens the optimization
% task. 
% % A number of measurement analysis papers have recently moved the netowkr bottleneck
% % close to the edges of the network.  This is a direct concequence of the low-cost
% % requirement of computer networks.  In order to enhance the edges, ISPs need to invest a
% % large amount of money in order to replace the connection medium and upgrade equipment in
% % the last mile. 
% 
% In order to 
% 
% Keeping in accordance with the  end-to-end principle of computer networks, a approach
% would be to develop more efficient protocols. Unfortunately, the requirement for fast
% connectivity at low cost, has assimilate to the network a number of strong assumtpions,
% that make it impossible to develop and propose new network protocol that address
% aforthmentioned problem. An alternative approach to the problem is to provde evolution
% through the control plane. Such approaches have been explored in the past without a lot of
% adaption. A recent development in the field is called {\it SDN} and gains a lot of
% interest from the comunity. 
% 
% In my thesis, I will firstly present a set of evaluation platform and results that try to
% understand the impact of the SDN paradigm, and especially its popular implementation {\it
% OpenFlow}. The result show that the protocol implementation are not yet sufficiently
% mature to be deployed across the network. Although, software implementations of the
% protocol are exceptionally efficiently. 
% 
% This observation drives my exploration on the possibilities of deploying OpenFlow in the
% edge of the network, close to end-users.
